[The AXR Project](http://axr.vg/) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/AXR/Prototype.png)](http://travis-ci.org/AXR/Prototype)
===============
The AXR Project is a revolutionary open source project that will fundamentally
improve our tools to create web sites and apps.

It's much in the style of current web standards, using plain text files linked
together to create the final site, but with a complete separation of content and
presentation, where the content is pure semantic data written in XML, and the
presentation and behavior layer is written in HSS, a new language based on CSS,
but with many powerful features, such as hierarchical notation, object
orientation, modularization for code reuse, expressions (math), vector graphics,
references (bindings between objects), and a very long etc.

Prototype
=========
The prototype of the AXR library and applications is written in C++. It uses Qt
for parsing XML and rendering the graphics, as well as other functionality.
It serves as a testing ground and for developing the initial draft of the core
library that will power the AXR platform.

Where to file bug reports
=========================
Please create a new issue here: https://github.com/AXR/Prototype/issues/new. To
make the process of fixing bugs easier, developers need to know what causes the
problem and also what platform(s) it affects. Be as detailed as possible, and
make sure to include the following points in your bug report:

 - What is happening
 - What you expected to happen
 - How to reproduce the issue
 - Your operating system and version
 - The version of AXR that is affected
