        This file tests relative and absolute path handling within AXR from both
        xml-stylesheet processing instructions in XML, and #import statements in
        HSS.

        Each HSS file successfully loaded will create a new element with the content
        "This file is {path}" where path is the exact path it was referenced using,
        within an xml-stylesheet or #import.

        Note that /root-absolute.hss will need to be symlinked from / for the test
        to work properly on local filesystems, and index.xml should be in the root
        directory over HTTP.

        The list of files that should get loaded (not necessarily in this order):
        * dotdot.hss
        * root-absolute.hss
        * root-relative.hss
        * dot.hss
        * relative.hss
